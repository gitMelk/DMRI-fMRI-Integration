# DMRI/fMRI Integration

Given resting state functional MRI and diffusion MRI data from an healthy
subject, the aim of the homework is to investigate their relationship. 

In order to do so, the following tasks have
been implemented:
- pre-processing on fMRI data;
- Functional Connectivity (FC) matrix computation and graph measures derivation;
- fit of the diffusion tensor;
- DTI metrics computation: Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Mean Diffusivity (MD);
- comparison between DTI parameters and connectivity measures.
This report and its related code are divided into 3 main sections: ยง 1 for the func-
tional MRI (fMRI) analysis, ยง 2 for the diffusion MRI analysis and ยง 3 for DMRI/fMRI
integration.
